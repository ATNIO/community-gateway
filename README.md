# Nectar Community

[nectar.community](nectar.community)

[The Ethfinex Nectar token (NEC)](https://github.com/ethfinex/nectar) is used for governance and entitles the holders to claim a share of the fees collected on Ethfinex.

[Ethfinex](https://www.ethfinex.com) is the first exchange which will be governed by its community of users, via the Nectar liquidity token (NEC). Nectar.community was created to allow NEC token holders to propose and vote on the future direction and decisions which Ethfinex takes. Traders on Ethfinex earn NEC by adding liquidity, and 50% of the fees generated by trading on Ethfinex are pledged to token holders as ETH.

These tools are created open-source to help NEC holders interact safely with the Nectar smart contracts. Over time these will evolve, and contributions of new features are welcomed. *Nectar.community has support for ledger, metamask, and keystore files*.

## Voting DApp

The voting in this implementation makes use of the properties of [Giveth's MiniMe token](https://github.com/giveth/minime).

Proposals are submitted by holders of NEC tokens, managed by `ProposalManager.sol`, and stored to a DHT using [Grenache](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/grenache), with the storage hash saved on Ethereum.

Once a proposal has been accepted by an admin, it triggers a clone of the NEC token to be created, giving all token holders a matching balance of voting tokens for the proposal. When a user casts their vote their tokens are destroyed.
